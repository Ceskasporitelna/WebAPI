## Contributing & posting issues

Found a bug in our API, want to tell us our documentation is not good enough, or have an idea for awesome API we should expose? Here are some hints on how to properly create an issue so that we can fix it as soon as possible.

### Security Issues

***Any security issues should be submitted directly to
<csirt@csas.cz>***

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask
yourself these two questions:

1. Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access
   to? 
2. Can I break something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably
dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both
questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if in doubt,
just email us at <csirt@csas.cz>.
